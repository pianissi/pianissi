## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I like making things to expand my knowledge, usually creatively.

Currently I'm working on:
- SplatRef, a local moodboard creation webapp built with NextJS and WebGL, with a online backend in Spring Boot / Java (online backend is not hosted). Also has support for multitouch zoom!: [Link](https://splat-ref.vercel.app/)

- Arcadey flight combat game in Godot .NET, mainly written in C#: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngbQVEUJIdU)

Some old stuff:
- In 2024, me and 4 friends made a puzzle platformer called Academy of Kinetic Magic, I helped create materials, post-processing stylised shaders, light environments, and create 2D design assets for it: [Link](https://infynidas.itch.io/the-academy-of-kinetic-magic)

- In 2022, I made a small webgame called Muse where you talk to a struggling musician through a video call to help them create their next song. This was mainly to learn how to use HTML Canvas alongside p5js to create a game: [Link](https://muse-2ad.pages.dev/)
